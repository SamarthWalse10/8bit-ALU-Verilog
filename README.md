# 8bit-ALU-Verilog
Design and Simulation of an 8-Bit Sequential ALU using Verilog.      

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an 8-Bit Sequential Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU). The ALU is a crucial component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) and is responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations.
## Overview
The objective of this project is to design and implement an 8-bit sequential ALU using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL). The project includes the coding of the ALU in Verilog and the simulation using Xilinx Vivado 2021.2.
## Features
- Supports 8-bit arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Performs logic operations including bitwise NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.
- Uses a sequential design approach for processing input operands and operation codes.
- Provides the corresponding output based on the selected operation code.
## Contents
The src directory contains the Verilog source code for the 8bit ALU.
The sim directory includes the simulation files and test bench code.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/SamarthWalse10/8bit-ALU-Verilog.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Verilog development environment.
3. Compile and synthesize the Verilog source code.
4. Simulate the design using the provided test bench.
5. Analyze the simulation results and verify the functionality of the 8bit ALU.
